                "DESCRIPTION": "Browny-orange soil, the colour I expect an orangutang's fur would be. Friable texture, breaks apart when manhandled. A few stones within the soil, also lots of small bugs and creepy crawlies. Great for growing mushrooms, peppers and onions. I have had fantastic yields on all of these plants. No need for fertiliser because I brought some manure from the nearby farm and applied it last summer. It seems as though the nutrients has remained there. Overall, a great soil for my back garden! ",
